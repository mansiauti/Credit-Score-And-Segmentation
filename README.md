Pandas,Numpy,Plotty,Scikit-Learn,K-Means Clustering


# Description
1.Used a dataset containing customer details like Payment history ,Credit utilization ratio ,loan amount, intrest rate , employment status.

2.Implemented a weighted formula inspired by FICO scoring model to assign credit scores based on key functional features.

3.Applied k-means clustering algorithm to group customer into four categories : Very low, Low ,Good,Excellent .

4.Used Plotty to analyze the distribution of credit utilization ,loan amounts and correlation between financial factors.
